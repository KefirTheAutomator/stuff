#+title: Stuff
My emacs configuration written as a library (with some additional utils in elisp).

* Installation
** Guix
I made this [[https://github.com/KefirTheAutomator/guix-channel/blob/main/kefir/pkgs/emacs.scm#L8][package]] for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Guix][Guix]]. After installing this package (or adding in your shell) eval this:
#+begin_src elisp :eval query
(require 'stuff)
(stuff-config)
#+end_src
I usually add it to my ~/.emacs file

* Dependencies
